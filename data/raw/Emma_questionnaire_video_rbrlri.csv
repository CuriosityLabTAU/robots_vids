I don't detect any notable difference between the robots, other than the color.  They seem to act and speak identically, or nearly enough so that I can't tell any difference.  There are slight, small, and ultimately meaningless differences in some of their movements when answering a question; but otherwise I see nothing to separate them.  They both seem fairly ... useless and bland.  Neither seems lifelike or to have any spark of humanity; not even a forced or artificial humanity.  Neither would be useful as a chatbot, for example.  If I were lonely or looking to talk, neither strikes me as able to participate in a conversation I would benefit from or enjoy.
