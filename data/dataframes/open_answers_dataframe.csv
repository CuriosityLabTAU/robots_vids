There are slight, small, and ultimately meaningless differences in some of their movements when answering a question; but otherwise I see nothing to separate them.  They both seem fairly ... useless and bland.  Neither seems lifelike or to have any spark of humanity; not even a forced or artificial humanity.  Neither would be useful as a chatbot, for example.

R_1rHqnJ6y1Vk7JyH,"The blue robot seems more intelligent and efficient. I noticed in a few videos that the red robot had some jerky movements. As much as the thought of artificial intelligence freaks me out, I would prefer to have the robot that is efficient than the one that seems like it has a few screws loose (pun intended).",half

R_dnzdcHAt33ys78R,Seemed nicer ,half

R_1opch7l3UWoa4fF,"I prefer the red robot as it seemed more logical and more rational (especially with questions 4, 5 and 6).   I thought that the blue robot had more emotions and more human-like features but it also felt as if the blue robot wasn't always making the most logical decisions (although I didn't necessarily agree with either robot for questions 1, 2 and 3).   Thus, I would prefer the red robot given the rational decision-making that I observed for questions 4, 5 and 6.",half
R_3LgMUGZPbChFD38,It ordered things more closely to how I would have,half
R_2q9LfWIrecZTBfX,I think both were pretty mechanical but at least I thought Red was generally more precise and accurate.,half
